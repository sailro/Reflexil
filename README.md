Reflexil
========

The .NET Assembly Editor

Reflexil is an assembly editor and runs as a plug-in for Red Gate's **Reflector**, **ILSpy** and **Telerik's JustDecompile**. Reflexil is using Mono.Cecil, written by Jb Evain and is able to manipulate IL code and save the modified assemblies to disk. Reflexil also supports C#/VB.NET code injection.
